Numerical solution of steady 2D Navier-Stokes eqns for Lid-driven cavity problem.
– Used a coupled stream function-vorticity formulation (PDEs) to represnt the flow domain.
– Discritized the PDEs using FDM, applied appropriate boundary condition and plotted stream. function & vorticity 
– Validate with Ghia et.al results
